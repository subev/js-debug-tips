- The good old breakpoint |
- The automatic breakpoint you need |
- 2.1 What to do next, climb up the stack and find your code |
- 2.2 If you frequently use this site, blackbox the scripts you want to ignore |
- If the code is minified prettify it (TODO yes we will cover sourcemaps a little bit later) |
- Hover to see the look around what is null or undefined |
- You have “fixed” the code and now it produces wrong results (awesome it does not blow but you have no idea wtf is going on). I present you the ‘debugger’ statement. |

- Those things are pretty powerful already. What else can we do with the debugger statement?
